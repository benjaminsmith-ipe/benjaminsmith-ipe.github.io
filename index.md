## Welcome

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/BenjaminSmithHeadshot.jpeg" width="350" height="350">

I am a researcher at the [Milken Institute](https://milkeninstitute.org/), an economic think-tank located in Santa Monica, CA. My research focuses on the intersection between technology and finance.

I received an MA in Political Science from [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) and a BA from [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/).

Prior to joining the Milken Institute, I was a trade policy researcher with the [Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/). I have also authored several op-eds with [The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/).
